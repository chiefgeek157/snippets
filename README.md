# Snippets

Code snippets I have found useful over the years. Each directory contains
topical code snippets. This is mostly here so I don't leave useful stuff
on some server.

Nothing here is guaranteed to work, and I take no responsibility for any
damage you do to your computer or your sanity by using this code. Use at
your own risk.
