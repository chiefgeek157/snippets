# This function must be loaded using "source" or "." command
# This file contains color codes and functions for coloring text in bash
# scripts. It defines various color codes and a function to colorize text.
#
# Use in "echo -e" statements of with the "log" function
#
# Example:
#   echo -e "${RE}This is red text${RS}"
#   echo -e "${GR}This is green text${RS}"
#
# To use in the shell prompt, PS1, you must use the following format:
#   PS1="\[$RE\] some text here \[$RS\]"
#   This example would print "some text here" in red, and reset the color
#   after.
# Note that the \[ and \] are required to prevent bash from miscalculating
#   the length of the prompt string. This is important for line wrapping
#   and cursor positioning. Those characters must be explicitly included
#   in the prompt string rather that coming from the variable value.

# Check if the script is being sourced
if [ "'${BASH_SOURCE[0]}'" == "'$0'" ]; then
    # Note: cannot use color variables yet because they are not loaded
